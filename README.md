Simple lootchest-system for RP-servers

Something i quickly whipped for you, these are the kind of resources you should'nt have to pay for. Nor should anyone even try to make money out of simple scripts like this. 

I wanted to make this cause i saw someone on forums trying to get money out of stuff like this, and that script was even simpler than this. 

Requirements;

-DPEmotes (https://forum.cfx.re/t/dpemotes-1-7-390-emotes-walkingstyles-keybinding-dances-expressions-and-shared-emotes/843105) -- For animations

-Progbar (https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-progress-bars-1-0-standalone/526287) --Not necessary, just comment out exports from client.lua

-Mythic notify (Though you can easily switch notifications from client.lua, just comment out mythic triggers and use ESX.ShowNotification('Hello world')

-ESX framework
